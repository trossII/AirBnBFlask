The purpose of this repo is to expand on what I have done in creating a machine learning model that provides BnB prices to new renters to base their home at by creating an app for their use. So far I have completed getting the app to run a 'lite' version of the machine learning model with limited features because the pickle of the model is too large to load onto github with my free account. I intend to find a way to possibly zip the full file at some point or create another model that gives me similar results in a smaller package. I then plan to release this app on the cloud for the community to check out.
